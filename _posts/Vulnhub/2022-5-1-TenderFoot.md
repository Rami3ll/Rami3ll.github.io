## Preface
  Hey there! This is my writeup for the Vulnhub machine [TenderFoot](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/tenderfoot-1,581/), Its described by it's author as "A very Easy Box for beginners", and is recommended for folks new to Vulnhub like myself. 
The task is simple, grab all 3 flags (user1.txt, user2.txt, proof.txt).
 
### Live Host Discovery
  This could essentially be done in 3 ways(that I know of):
 - Arp-scan
 - Netdiscover
 - Nmap ping sweep scan aka ICMP packet reception scan
My Go-to is Netdiscover:

```
sudo netdiscover -i wlan0 -r 192.168.x.x/24
```
- sudo because netdicover requires root permission to inject & sniff packets across a local network
- The netdiscover command utility
- -i to scan a selected interface
- -r to scan a specified range of subnet  (Defaults take forever!)

### Port Scan
  To discover an attack surface:
```
â”Œâ”€â”€(azazelã‰¿azazel)-[~/Vulnhub/TenderFoot]
â””â”€$ sudo nmap -sV -sC -sS  192.168.0.141 -Pn -p- --min-rate 2000 -vv

We got http and ssh, cool
On http, its just default landing page we meet,
![image](/assets/img/posts/vulnhub/TenderFoot/landing.png)

checking the source code, at the bottom 
```
<!--
G00D! 
check /robots.txt directory.
-->

```
we got a hint to check the robots.txt::
```

Here is a directory open it 

/hint

```
Okay a clue to a hidden directory let's see where this leads, On first sight it seems blank but on viewing the source, hidden at the extreme bottom is an encoded text screaming base32(Can be identified with all upper casing characters and paddings(==)although paddings are not always present)::
```
<!--
EBPV6X27L5PV6X27L5PV6X27L5PV6X27L4FHYICOGB2GQ2LOM4QEQZLSMUQSAIBAEAQCA7AKPQQFI4TZEBZW63LFORUGS3THEBSWY43FEF6AUIBNFUWS2LJNFUWS2LJNFUWS2LJNFUWS2LIKIVXHK3LFOJQXIZJANVXXEZJAHIUQ====

Decrypt it!
-->
```
On decoding it says:
![image](/assets/img/posts/vulnhub/TenderFoot/deadend1.png)

welp that's sad, moving on, I decide to do a directory enumeration, after trying out around 5 wordlists 

I finally get a hit with seclists::
![image](/assets/img/posts/vulnhub/TenderFoot/dirsearch.png)

We know /hint is a deadend let's visit /fotocd


![image](/assets/img/posts/vulnhub/TenderFoot/brainfuck.png)

lesserthan, greaterthan, full stops, straight brackets, addition signs, and what not, no doubt its the esoteric brainfuck::
We could decode with either [this interperter](https://copy.sh/brainfuck/) or [decode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/brainfuck-language)
![image](/assets/img/posts/vulnhub/TenderFoot/brainfuck-decode.png)

Awesome, we have a better clue, a base64 encoded header and a hint that we would need to look for a username:
On decoding the header we get::
```                                                                                                             
â”Œâ”€â”€(azazelã‰¿azazel)-[~/Vulnhub/TenderFoot]
â””â”€$ echo -n JDk5OTkwJA== | base64 -d

$99990$  
```
We have what seems to be a password, to find complete creds of a user, we could either do a password spray with hydra to find a username OR enumerate once again.
Due to hydra time constraints and limited threads on ssh bruteforcing, I enumerated again, except this time with extensions(I did leave hydra to bruteforce in the background:)):
```
dirsearch -u http://192.168.0.141/ -w  /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-big.txt -t 250 -e js,php,txt,xml 
```
we get the entry.js has a user, "monica"


![image](/assets/img/posts/vulnhub/TenderFoot/username.png)

Lets login on ssh with her creds! monica:$99990$

### Initial Access
  ![image](/assets/img/posts/vulnhub/TenderFoot/access1.png)

And we're in! Lets play around ðŸ˜ˆ Here's our first flag! 
Next we have this Joey directory with a whole bunch of other subdirectories :) just tab autocomplete your way to the relevant file
  ![image](/assets/img/posts/vulnhub/TenderFoot/access2.png)
  
We have a new clue, the fotocd subdirectory::

![image](/assets/img/posts/vulnhub/TenderFoot/parent-dir.png)

We have access to the parent directory of the site and have a zip protected file and a note.txt file waiting for us, just grab those and check them out:
First the note.txt::

```
Here is a zip file for you, unzip it !

"#9175"

```
A password to our zip? this is almost too easy.
Unzipping our file, we have the Joey.zip file containing another zip protected file and a note.txt, *sigh

The note file says:
```
â”Œâ”€â”€(azazelã‰¿azazel)-[~/Vulnhub/TenderFoot]
â””â”€$ cat note.txt
=======================================================
=======================================================
Not this time DUDE!

Just G00GLE and learn how to crack zip passwords :)

you will learn new thing!
=======================================================
=======================================================
```
Touche::
crack the gift.zip file and we got this:
![image](/assets/img/posts/vulnhub/TenderFoot/crack.png)

Just a clue for us to find SUID  binaries, of course we would have done that if he didn't lead us onðŸ˜‚
Checking for SUID binaries, I spotted an odd binary, on executing it, we became another user, Awesome
Cop the user2.txt flag.
![image](/assets/img/posts/vulnhub/TenderFoot/chandler.png)

Now to gain elevated privileges, 
> if there's anything this box taught me is always try to get user creds to login properly over a pty cause sometimes the SUID Biniaries set for that user might not really display as they should.

Luckily for us we have a new clue, a base32 encoded charset::


```
â”Œâ”€â”€(azazelã‰¿azazel)-[~/Vulnhub/TenderFoot]
â””â”€$ echo -n OBQXG43XMQ5FSMDVINZDIY3LJUZQ==== | base32 -d

passwd:Y0uCr4ckM3        
```
Cool this might just be chandlers creds. lets try logging in

### Root tooth 
Even without [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/ftp/#sudo) enabling sudo on ftp is a clean shot to get root.
![image](/assets/img/posts/vulnhub/TenderFoot/root.png)

And that's it, fully compromised!

Due to the emergence of findings of newer vulnerabilities and evolving tech, there are so many ways to get root instantly on this machine, one of which is Pwnkit(CVE-2021-4034)which allows us abuse pkexec by virtue of SUID bit set on the binary, nonetheless those are all unintended ways and not ideal.:)

Thanks for the read.
