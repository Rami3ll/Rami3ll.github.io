##  Whoami?
  > Hi there! I'm Daniel Olamide Johnson also known as Rami3l, an infosec & Aerospace enthusiast, currently studying my Bsc in Cyber security,  I love anime, video games and cyber security stuff, with keen interests in Military and Threat intelligence, looking to specialize in those.

## About this blog 
> This blog was created mainly about my own personal thoughts and tutorials on IT security because of my deep interest on infosec and CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence) specifically, and in a bid to document my journey through the domains and intricacies of Information Security and related topics as well as my growth from n00b to elite XD. Anything on this blog was on my own writing and it's contents are things that I've learned and would love to share.
>> The writings also will be my future reference. Hopefully my little write ups here will be of great help and/or benefits.
 
## Finally
>Thank you for reading my blog post and I hope you have as much fun reading it as I had writing it.
>>This is and always will be a noob space! great to have you here mate! Welcome to my little corner.
